## 5. Data Sharing and Third Parties

### 5.1 Third-Party Service Providers

We use the following third-party services to operate the App:

These providers process data on our behalf and are bound by their respective privacy policies and data processing agreements.

### 5.2 What We Do NOT Share

- We do not sell your personal information to third parties
- We do not share your personal information (email, username, messages) with sponsors or advertisers. Sponsors receive only aggregate, anonymized performance metrics (total impressions, clicks, and click-through rates) for their campaigns.
- We do not provide your email address to other users (your username is your public identifier)
- We do not share your precise location coordinates with other users (only the area-level location and any location text you voluntarily include in listings)

### 5.3 Information Visible to Other Users

The following information is visible to other App users:

- **Public profile**: Username, account creation date, email verification status, vetted status, primary area
- **Item listings**: Title, description, category, photos, location text, area, availability date
- **Aggregate ratings**: Average scores across all categories and number of ratings received
- **Board posts and replies**: Content, username, and timestamp
- **Messages**: Visible only to the other participant in a conversation

The following is **never** visible to other users:

- Your email address
- Your password
- Your precise GPS coordinates (only area-level and voluntary location text)
- Your push notification token
- Your activity metrics or login history
- Your notification preferences

### 5.4 Administrator Access

Our administrators and moderators may access:

- User email addresses and account details (for moderation and support purposes)
- Item listings and photos (for content review)
- Reports and flags submitted by users
- Aggregate user statistics
- Community vote records (for moderation oversight)

All administrator actions are logged in an audit trail that records the administrator, action taken, target, details, and IP address.

### 5.5 Legal Requirements

We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., court orders, subpoenas).

---

## 6. Push Notifications

### 6.1 Token Collection

When you enable push notifications, your device's push notification token (Expo Push Token) is stored on our servers. This token is:

- Collected when you register for notifications
- Cleared when you log out
- Automatically removed if the token becomes invalid (e.g., app uninstalled)

### 6.2 Notification Types

| Notification | Default | Can Disable |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| New messages | Enabled | Yes |
| Item status changes (claimed, collected) | Enabled | Yes |
| New items in your area | Enabled | Yes |
| Community board activity | Enabled | Yes |

### 6.3 Quiet Hours

You may configure quiet hours (start time, end time, and timezone) during which notifications are deferred and delivered after the quiet period ends. The default timezone is Pacific/Auckland (New Zealand).

### 6.4 Batch Processing

Area-wide notifications (e.g., new items posted) are sent in batches of up to 100 recipients and respect individual notification preferences.

---

## 7. Cookies and Tracking

The mobile App does not use cookies. Authentication is handled via JWT tokens stored securely on your device using platform-native secure storage (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore via Expo SecureStore). The web-based administration interface uses httpOnly session cookies for administrator authentication only; these are not used for tracking.

---

## 8. Data Security

### 8.1 Technical Safeguards

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt and never stored or transmitted in plain text
- All API communication uses HTTPS encryption
- Real-time messaging uses authenticated WebSocket connections
- Rate limiting protects against automated attacks
- Database queries use parameterized inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Administrator accounts require two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- Verification codes expire after 30 minutes and are single-use
- Mobile tokens are stored in platform-native secure storage (not plain AsyncStorage)

### 8.2 Organizational Safeguards

- Administrator actions are fully audited with IP address logging
- Administrator roles are tiered (moderator, admin, super_admin) with appropriate access levels
- Database backups are maintained for disaster recovery

### 8.3 No Guarantee of Security

**WHILE WE IMPLEMENT REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES, NO METHOD OF ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OR STORAGE IS 100% SECURE. WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.** You acknowledge that you provide your information at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any security measures contained in the App.

### 8.4 Breach Notification

In the event of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify affected users via email and/or in-app notification as soon as practicable, and no later than required by applicable law.

---

## 10. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we discover that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information, we will promptly delete that information.

---

## 11. Email Quarantine and Peer Review

### 11.1 How It Works

Our system may automatically quarantine email addresses that match certain patterns during registration. Quarantined email addresses are reviewed by established community members (peer reviewers) who vote to approve or reject the email. This process:

- Uses only the **normalized email address** (not the full registration details)
- Requires multiple peer reviews before a decision is made
- May result in the email being approved, remaining quarantined, or being permanently blocked
- Is designed to prevent abuse while minimizing false positives

### 11.2 Your Rights

If your email is quarantined, you will be informed. You may contact us to request a manual review of your quarantine status.

---

## 12. Community Voting and Reputation

### 12.1 Voting System

Established users (verified email, vetted status, 30+ days account age, 3+ completed transactions) may cast community votes on other users. These votes:

- Are stored with the voter's identity and reason
- May affect your ability to use certain App features if block votes reach threshold levels
- Are visible to administrators for moderation oversight
- Are not publicly visible to other users

### 12.2 Ratings

Transaction ratings are publicly visible in aggregate (average scores and count). Individual rating details (scores, comments, rater identity) are visible on your profile. You may dispute ratings through the in-app dispute process.

---

## 13. International Data Transfers

Your data may be processed and stored in locations outside your country of residence, including through our use of cloud services (Cloudflare R2 for image storage, cloud-hosted databases). By using the App, you consent to the transfer of your information to these locations.

---

## 14. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by:

- Posting the updated policy in the App
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document

Your continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
